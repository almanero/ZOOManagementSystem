# Zoo Management System
A Zoo Management System (ZMS) is a comprehensive, often web-based or cloud-based, software solution designed to streamline and automate the various operational, managerial, and administrative duties involved in running a zoo or aquarium. It aims to improve efficiency, enhance animal welfare, ensure regulatory compliance, and enrich the visitor experience. 
1. Animal and Habitat Management
This is a core function, central to the zoo's mission of animal welfare and conservation. 
Record Keeping: Maintaining detailed, centralized databases for each animal, including unique identifiers, species, genetic information, birth/death updates, and behavioral observations.
Health and Medical Records: Tracking vaccinations, treatments, routine check-ups, and diagnostic testing. This module assists veterinarians in making informed decisions about animal health.
Dietary Management: Recording specific feeding schedules, dietary components, and any restrictions to ensure balanced nutrition.
Habitat and Enclosure Management: Monitoring environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) and scheduling cleaning, maintenance, and security checks to ensure optimal living conditions and safety.
Breeding and Population Management: Planning breeding programs to ensure genetic diversity, tracking pedigrees, and managing population sustainability, often in collaboration with global networks and Species Survival Plans (SSPs).
2. Visitor Management and Ticketing
This process focuses on the guest experience and revenue generation. 
Online and On-site Ticketing: Facilitating the sale of tickets (single entry, group, family, etc.) through various channels like online platforms, self-service kiosks, and physical counters.
Membership Management: Handling membership sales, renewals, and the associated benefits like discounts or special access.
Access Control: Managing entry points using systems like QR codes or RFID wristbands to track visitors and ensure secure access to different areas.
Visitor Engagement: Providing interactive features like digital maps, event schedules (e.g., animal feedings, shows), and educational content to enhance the visit.
Feedback Collection: Gathering visitor feedback through surveys or ratings to help improve services.
3. Operations and Staff Management
Streamlining internal operations to ensure smooth functioning. 
Staff Scheduling and Task Allocation: Managing employee and volunteer shifts, assigning specific duties (e.g., a keeper assigned to cleaning, another to feeding), and tracking attendance.
Inventory and Resource Management: Monitoring stock levels for food supplies, medical equipment, and merchandise, and generating reorder alerts to prevent shortages.
Maintenance Management: Handling service requests and work orders for facilities and equipment, from minor repairs to preventive maintenance, ensuring a safe and functional environment.
4. Financial Management and Reporting
Providing financial oversight and data-driven insights. 
Revenue Tracking: Monitoring income from ticket sales, donations, gift shops, and other sources.
Budgeting and Cost Assessment: Tracking expenditures related to inventory, staffing, and operations to ensure financial sustainability.
Reporting and Analytics: Generating reports on visitor trends, animal health metrics, and financial performance to support informed decision-making and strategic planning.
Ensuring the zoo operates responsibly and contributes to global efforts. 
Regulatory Compliance: Maintaining necessary documentation and records to meet national and international regulations and accreditation standards (e.g., AZA standards).
Conservation Data Sharing: Contributing data to centralized global databases, such as the Zoological Information Management System (ZIMS), to support research and species preservation efforts.
